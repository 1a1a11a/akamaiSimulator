usage: ./akamaiSimulatorBin -c config -s size -t traceType -o outputFolder -b boundary (optional) -d


config file is a list of traces

size is L1 + L2 cache size

traceType is a number of version of akamaiTrace, current version is 3 (the sixth col is request, the first column is time)

outputFolder is the path for output, output format
Layer:         reqCount, hitCount, layerOverallHitRatio, *perSeverLayerHitRatio
Server:        overallReqCount, overallHitCount, overallHitRatio, layerSize, layerReqCount, layerHitCount, layerHitRatio
akamaiStat:     overallAvgLatency, avgLayer1HitRatio, avgLayer2HitRatio, trafficToOrigin, trafficBetweenLayers

boundary is the specified boundary between L1 and L2, 0.2 means sizeL1=0.2*size, sizeL2=0.8*size
-d is to turn on dynamic boundary
